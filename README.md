# Tutor Bidding System
## Architecture: MVC

### Tutor monitoring dashboard
Design Pattern: Observer Pattern

During the bidding session, students must be able to capture all the bidding votes from other participants on a tutor monitoring dashboard.

### Contract expiration and renewal
Student can initiated a contract once the bidding session is over. Contract established between students and tutor could expired and renewal of that particular contract can be done once the contract is expired and the student wish to continue with the tutor.

### Reuse previous contract
Design Pattern: Strategy Pattern

Students are able to reuse the previous contract, restoring the existing requirements on previous contract once that contract is expired.
