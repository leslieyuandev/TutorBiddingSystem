# Tutor Bidding System
## Architecture: MVC

### Tutor monitoring dashboard
Design Pattern: Observer Pattern

Students must be able to capture all the bidding votes from other participated students on a tutor monitoring dashboard.

### Contract expiration and renewal
Contract established between students and tutor could expired and renewal of that particular contract can be done once the contract is expired.

### Reuse previous contract
Design Pattern: Strategy Pattern

Students are able to reuse the previous contract given the existing requirements listed once the contract is expired.
